-- Both Q5a (COUNT) and Q5b (COUNT DISTINCT) have the same results since the customer table
-- has a list of all the customers and their info. Every customer appears only once in the customer table
-- already, so the table already shows distinct counts.

-- Based on the ERD, CustomerID field for CustomerCatergoryMembership, it has a one-to-one relationship
-- with the CustomerID field from the customer table. Meaning, for every customerID in the customercategorymembership
-- table, there is only one customerID in the customer table. 
-- Then, The CustomerCategoryID in the CustomerCategory table can correspond to 
-- multiple CustomerCategoryID in the CustomerCatergoryMembership, However this will not increase
-- the number of rows since it is a left join.

-- Q6
-- The IN operator can be used instead of multiple OR operators in WHERE statements. 
-- The general syntax is:
-- SELECT city, state
  -- FROM location_subset
  -- WHERE state IN('California', 'Arizona', 'Washington');

  -- Modify query 4 to only show customers in Kansas, Colorado, and Utah.  
  -- Use the IN operator in your WHERE statement.
