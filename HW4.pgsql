-- Before we start with windowing, we will create a view[1] that will be used as input into our windowing analyses: 
-- Use the SalesOrderHeader and the SalesOrderLine tables to create a view with three columns, 
-- SalespersonID, ReportingYear, and SalesInMillions.   
-- Name the view AnnualSalesPersonSales. SalespersonID is salespersonpersonid, sales is calculated at the line item level
-- as quantity*unitprice*(1+taxrate/100). 
-- The results should show SalesInMillions as total sales in millions for each sales person each year rounded to 
-- three decimals. Sort the results by SalesPersonID and Year. 
-- Exclude sales from 2016 as the data does not contain transactions for the entire year 2016.
